This mod randomly turns birds into The Biggest Bird upon spawn. When a bird is The Biggest Bird they become the biggest and sing how they are the biggest bird. The default spawn chance of The Biggest Bird is 5%.

This mod is client sided only.

## Building

You'll need to set up references properly, and then you'll need an embedded resource assetbundle called "biggestbirdassets" with an AudioClip called "bird"

## Installation (manual)
Put the plugin in your BepInEx/plugins folder.

## Configuration

You can change the audio distance of The Biggest Bird, and the spawn chance of The Biggest Bird via the config.
